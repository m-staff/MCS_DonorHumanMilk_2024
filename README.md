There are two Python files that provide the opportunity to experiment with parameters at the national level for the case study of England and Wales (DHM_demand_MC_national_experiments), and Trust level data for England (DHM_demand_MC_trust_experiments). 
The Trial.xlsx file contains data sets required for experiments; Trust_Experiments.xlsx and National_Experiments.xlsx are empty files where results get written into once the simulation is run.  

For all enquiries, please contact Marta Staff (ms670@exeter.ac.uk).
